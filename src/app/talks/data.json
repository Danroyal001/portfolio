You ask your boss, please? But (s)he still says, no! How about instead of missing class, you try something different? Well, the Angular team has something cool for you... Angular Elements! Angular Elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements, a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. Learn how to write and package your Angular components to be used across any framework (or no framework) by extending HTML to allow you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by your Angular code. Now you can put your Angular components into any other frameworks components!

The web has become so much more powerful in what we can do, though. JavaScript frameworks allow developers to build powerful web app with a fraction of the time and resources of native apps. While tools like Ionic are allowing developers to make beautiful web apps that look and behave so much like native application with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference. Even cooler is now you can install apps from the web onto your phone like a native app. The web is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and you should be taking advantage of this. Learn what makes a progressive web app so progressive and some of the tooling you can use to build amazing (web) apps!","url":"https://youtu.be/cNoPCeTuM3M","src":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNoPCeTuM3M/default.jpg","date":"2019-01-30T14:17:00Z"},{"title":"TechDuels: Angular vs. React","description":"//Crew\n\nDirector: Ben Halpern\nProducer: Jess Lee & Peter Frank\nDirector of Photography: Matthew Figler\nCamera Operator: Adam Kolodny\nSound Mixer: Mike Fowler\nSupervising Editor: Jess Lee\nEditor: Jon Appel","url":"https://youtu.be/P-T-zrPSsy4","src":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-T-zrPSsy4/default.jpg","date":"2017-07-13T21:40:41Z"},{"title":"Building Modern Web Apps","description":"In this talk, Checkmate's Michael Solati and Robert Crowdis take a look at the differences between web apps and web sites, and build a web app all in one hour!\n\nDevFest New Haven is Connecticut's largest conference for learning about Google tech.

Wether your making an apps to find restaurants nearby, call a taxi, or swipe right on the person of your dreams, location matters! Firebase makes for an amazing tool and database service, but it doesn't support geo related queries out the box. That's ok though with some cool and fancy algorithms we can handle geo-queries in real time with Firebase.","url":"https://youtu.be/LPA12-1vsgw","src":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPA12-1vsgw/default.jpg","date":"2018-01-17T21:16:05Z"},{"title":"michael solati and robert crowdis, College Tech Challenge Champions","description":"Michael Solati - SCSU Student, College Tech Challenge Champion\nRobert Crowdis - SCSU Student, College Tech Challenge Champion\n\n \nâ€¢ The College Tech Challenge and Hiring Fair brought together the top 50 engineering and programming students in the state to compete for two $5000 cash prizes last month in Bristol.\nâ€¢ The event is organized by the Connecticut Technology Council, a trade association for tech businesses in Connecticut and building tech community in the state.
